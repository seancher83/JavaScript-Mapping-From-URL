# JavaScript-Mapping-From-URL
Built to take a url with addresses as query strings and create a Google Map with markers

Our company is using a Filemaker database.  Filemaker has a built in web browswer that I wanted to utilize to place our daily customer locations on a map. In order to do so I can create a script in Filemaker in order to compile all service locations into a URL.  I built this program to parse the url into addresses, turn those addresses into Long/Lat and then plot them on a map. 

# Future Plans
This method does not allow me to embed service descriptions as the tag headers.
